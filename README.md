This project, STRATOSENSE-APP, is a web application designed for air quality monitoring, forecasting, and health alerts. It provides real-time data visualization, interactive dashboards, and predictive analytics using a machine learning Decision Tree model.

Key features and details:

The frontend is built with React (TypeScript), Vite, and Tailwind CSS, offering a fast, responsive, and modern user interface.
The backend is developed in Python (using FastAPI or a similar framework), handling API requests, data processing, and serving machine learning predictions.
A Decision Tree machine learning model is used to predict air quality metrics based on environmental data.
Data visualization is achieved using Chart.js, enabling users to view trends, heatmaps, and forecasts.
The app includes health alerts based on AQI (Air Quality Index) and provides a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring.
Package management is handled by npm (for frontend) and pip (for backend).
Linting and code quality are maintained with ESLint.
The project structure supports modular development, with clear separation of frontend, backend, and machine learning components.
Overall, STRATOSENSE-APP enables users to monitor air quality, receive forecasts and health alerts, and visualize environmental data in an accessible and interactiveÂ way.
